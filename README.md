# Game Title: Galactic Drift

## Backstory
Far in the future, humanity’s final space colony hovers on the brink of destruction. In Galactic Drift, you control a highly advanced sentient spaceship built to defend the colony from an onslaught of cosmic threats. Asteroids and comets fill the galaxy's edge, threatening to breach the colony’s defenses. As the colony’s final line of protection, the spaceship’s mission is to navigate through hazardous conditions, intercept drifting resources, and shield the colony from incoming dangers.
